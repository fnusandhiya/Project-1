# YELP Analysis


## Introduction:

### Yelp is becoming a popular way to find great local businesses. From restaurant to medical service, people can easily obtain helpful information from Yelp reviews. Using Yelp can help people easily find the service that meet their expectation. And we have used the Yelp API to get the information of random businesses of Cleveland, Ohio. And we took a sample size of 500 businesses.


## Motivation:

### Have you ever gone to a restaurant based on its Yelp rating or after reading a rave review only to feel upset because the food quality did not meet your 5-star gourmet expectations.  We analyzed different questions and used the publicly available Yelp API to classify alot of different things from that.


## Dataset:

### Our dataset is from Yelp Fusion API. The dataset contains JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. We transformed JSON files to csv files so that we can apply Python Pandas to analyze the dataset.

## Initial Question:

### Our next action plan was simple. Discover the Yelp Dataset, dig deep and find interesting connections. We realized that our data only allowed us to take the track to analyze business. Hence, we dug deeper into that data and came up with number of question before we decided to evaluate user data in greater detail.
